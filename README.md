# Intro to Numerical Analysis Using Python and Git 
Learning Python syntax is one thing, but learning to use code to perform numerical analysis is a signficant step towars learning to become an effective data scientist. Project Euler is one of my favorite resources to practice using code to solve problems. This repository is intended to allow teammates a place to put code and practice basic version control skills.

# Edit: Trey Euler Problem Set
This branch will contain work on Euler problem set as part of python training.
