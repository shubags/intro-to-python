Let's use the fact that we can express a Pythagorean triplet in terms of
two numbers m,n using the following relationships.

       a = m^2 - n^2
       b = 2 * m * n
       c  = m^2 + n^2
because,
       a^2 = m^4 + n^4 â€“ 2*m^2*n^2
       b^2 = 4*m^2*n^2
       c^2 = m^4 + n^4 + 2*m^2*n^2

By looping over m, n we can generate pythagorean triplets instead of trying to
loop over the three numbers (a, b, c)
